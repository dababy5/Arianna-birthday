      Hello Baby you are probably reading this in the morning I made two versions one with chat-gpt and this one the first is for your parents to read and the second is for you to read with the password I gave you on docs. I want to firstly say Happy birthday to my prettiest girlfriend. You have been literally the reason I breathe everyday and I don't just say that I mean it. Without life would lose all it's colors and it literally does. Today after seeing you made me realize how sad I usually am.
      Seeing you today all dressed up really made my Jaw drop I take you so so so for granted I forget how beautiful you are I swear. my girlfriend is the prettiest girl in the world üôÅ. I be getting Jealous as fuck when a guy looks at her. Jokes aside I really wish I could have given your other gift unfortunately I wasn't able to because I was dumb but I hope this website will suffice for now. Thank you for always being there for me, I think I am genuinely so lucky to have a partner like you. Knowing I can always speak to you about anything really helps me face the world because I know in the end I can always vent to you. You have really helped me become vulnerable over the past year baby I don't give you enough credit in that aspect either I was literally like a mess and your steady consistent love has changed me a lot. Please never change that aspect about yourself , the way you love me is perfect I am sorry I sometimes make it seem like it isn't or that you aren't enough but you are. I don't want you to forget that even when I am a lot it's always me on me everything I say is a projection a lot of the times is a of my insecurities. I will work on this for you, so I can be the best partner you can have. 
      I plan on marrying you ya know like for real that's why I work so hard. I want you to live an easy life , I wanna take care of you and keep you safe. I will always learn even if I don't understand I will make myself, hell if I need to do wrong things just to keep you safe I would do it. You are just that amazing that I would do these things baby, you are literally one of my greatest insparations for your work ethic and kindness. I want our kids to have the same kindness and work ethic you have.To finish baby I just want you to know that in every world and in every Universe you are going to be the person I love

    <p>I remember the first time we went out. The pretty little dress you whore for me, I remember everything. Honestly that day went by too short but to this Day that memory is def top 3 and not only for the fact we kissed üòä during that movie. That day was very special to me as well because I experienced basic things I thought could never happen like eating ice cream with you whiile sitting outside. As well as even just "watching" that movie we did not finish it LOL but still these things I finally could do with someone i love and not alone that is what meant a lot for me. I remember walking through that bookstore and seeing your mischievious little smile. There are so many things I wanted to say but all I could do is smile back since I couldn't contain how happy I was.</p>

    <p>Hai baby this is the first time we have ever met. This day was very magical for me I felt so numb. I remember on the car ride there you were singing and we both sang and ngl I found it cringe at first but in the end I ended up singing too. You really had a way of breaking me out of my shell. I love that about you , you always smile so beautifully. Now back to the story sonsa, I remember how beautiful your hair was that day it was short and it is still beautiful right now but I remember that day it was short. You had a slight hint of eyeliner and you were wearing this puffer jacket. I even remember the bad scent of your hair baby tiss was not good for thou nose. I am just joking with you but the point is I remember that day really well and from the moment we stepped foot in the park I felt like good things were coming and they did. The initial ride was okay Dasha didn't want help she faced her fears herself but the one after were you first sat next to me gave me such a warm feeling. It felt like so nice to finally be needed it felt so good and I remember looking at you , you didn't notice because well I try to be discreet
      ü§´. I will always love remembering that moment I felt so happy that I completely forgot about the ride. I remember after that we were locked in together for the rest of the rides, I remember even scaring you an you waiting for me 
    for each ride. Honestly you had me good baby. I think the moment I found you prettiest was when it rained a little and we were both wwalking to get on the spinning swings before we left
  and while we were walking there I looked over at you and was stunned by how beautiful you were. Your smeared eye liner with your messed up hair but you were having fun, idk I just loved it. So many thoughts ran through my head I remember I didn't want the night to stop there so I planned to text you and well we are here now my plan succeeded which I am so very proud off because I can  proudly say I have literally the best girlfriend in the world.</p>
